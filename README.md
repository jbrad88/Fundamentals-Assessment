## Introduction
This GitHub repository contain my submission for my project for Programming for Data Analysis 2021. Within this repository, you will find
two Jupyter notebook titled "pyplot.ipynb" and "cao-points-analysis.ipynb" which can be run as outlined under "General Usage Information" below. The purpose of the code 
contained within is to meet the following objectives:

1. pyplot.ipynb
Create a Jupyter notebook called pyplot.ipynb that contains the following:
* A clear and concise overview of the matplotlib.pyplot Python package.
* An in-depth explanation of three interesting plots from the matplotlib.pyplot Python package.

2. cao-points-analysis.ipynb
We have been tasked with creating a Jupyter notebook which contains the following:

* A clear and concise overview of how to load CAO points information from the CAO website into a pandas data frame.
* A detailed comparison of CAO points in 2019, 2020, and 2021 using the functionality in pandas.
* Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.

## Prerequisites
Before you continue, make sure that you have met the following requirements:

You have installed Python 3.8.3
You have installed the latest version of Anaconda.

## Technologies
Python 3.8.3
Anaconda
pandas
NumPy
Seaborn
matplotlib

## General usage information
1. For ease of use, I recommend having Anaconda installed on your machine. 
2. Download ZIP package and unzip it. The unzipped folder will include the jupyter notebooks.
3. Access the jupyter notebook by launching Anaconda Navigator and then launching Jupyter Notebook. Navigate to the relevant directory and open the notebook.
4. Run cells to view outputs.
